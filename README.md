# Hand-Gesture
Start Position: Hold your dominant hand in front of you, palm facing upward.
Action: Imagine you’re lifting an imaginary box (representing your project) off your palm. Use both hands to mimic the action of lifting.
Gesture: As you lift, move your hands upward, as if you’re placing the project into the cloud.
Final Position: With both hands above your head, open your palms outward to symbolize “uploading” to the cloud.
